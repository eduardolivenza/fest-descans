##Getting Started

* **Maven**: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

### Spring profiles

#### Profiles summary:

| Profile        | Main purposes | Physical database used | Automatic actions performed on baseProject domain tables during bootstrap | Automatic actions performed on INFINITY tables during bootstrap |
| ------------- |---|-------------|-----|---|
| development      | Development, functional reviews | Infinity instance | none | none |
| debug      |Product environment with debug traces | Infinity instance | none| none |
| prod      | Production environment| Infinity instance |   none | none |
| controller-to-secondary-adapters-with-in-memory-h2      | backend automatic testing with a fake database | in-memory H2      | drops and creates empty tables | drops and creates empty tables |

In order to activate profiles you have to use the option `-Dspring.profiles.active=` or you have to pass the argument `--spring.profiles.active=`.

#### Development
Intended for run the application in a development (maybe testing) environment. **This profile drops and creates the tables with no data on each run**.

1. Be sure that an Infinity instance is running in your environment
2. In the command-line run the baseProject (e.g. `baseProject-runtime-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`) with the development profile:
    
    Defining application arguments (`--`):`java -jar baseProject-runtime-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=development`
    
    or
    
    Defining system properties (`-D`): `java -Dspring.profiles.active=development -jar baseProject-runtime-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

#### Production
Intended for run the application in a production environment. **This profile has no database initialization task**.

1. Be sure that an Infinity instance is running in your environment
2. In the command-line run the baseProject (e.g. `baseProject-runtime-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`) with the production profile:
    
    Defining application arguments (`--`):`java -jar baseProject-runtime-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod`
    
    or
    
    Defining system properties (`-D`): `java -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -jar baseProject-runtime-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
    
### Other spring profiles

#### controller-to-secondary-adapters-with-in-memory-h2
Intended for backend automatic testing. **This profile uses a fake in-memory database (H2)**. Typically used during maven lifecycle.


### Run tests
1. Go to baseProject pom.xml directory at the repository root
2. Execute `mvn clean verify` (http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html)

### Deployment
Application is deployed at `[scheme]://[host]:8090`

Typical example in a development environment: `http://localhost:8090`
### Web API
* You can find the Web API documentation in JSON format at `[scheme]://[host]:8090/v2/api-docs`.
* You can find a simple client (also the documentation) at `[scheme]://[host]:8090/swagger-ui.html`

### Continuous integration

http://jenkins.kiosk.eolivenza.com/job/Projects/job/eolivenza.DE.LIS/job/infinity-baseProject/

### Test annotation
In order to synchronize the IT to HPALM we can add tags to our tests. 
Those tags can be added at Class level, and then will apply to all the tests methods of the class.

See README at https://stash.intranet.eolivenza.com/stash/projects/RDA/repos/test-definition-annotations/browse


##### Rules:
 1. A task branch can only be merged into a PBI branch after a pull request
 1. PBI branches will only be merged into master once all tasks are finished (including functional reviews, acceptance tests and development tasks)
 1. Once a pull request is approved and completed, the source branch must be deleted 
 1. Be aware of remote branches changes (i.e. often do fetch and merge if necessary as well as to review often the status of the ancestors branches)
 
##### Best scenario
In order to minimize the synchronization overhead between branches, each PBI branch should be smaller enough to avoid
the creation of task branches.
 
###Step by step
1. Create a 'feature/PBI/my-new-task' branch from master in TFS. Example: `feature/PBI12345/AddInstrumentTobaseProject`
1. Commit your changes to the task branch: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
1. Push to the task branch: `git push origin feature/PBI/my-new-task`
1. Submit a pull request from task branch to 'master' branch in TFS and add a reviewer :D
